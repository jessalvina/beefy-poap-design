# BEEFY - POAP Design

Welcome! Here are some of my artworks for Beefy POAP Design

Beefy is a Multichain Yield Optimizer that focuses on safety and autocompounds crypto assets for the best APYs. As part of our Launchpool offering we promote exciting projects and BOOST certain vaults with the partners token in order to give the best APY to our users.

#### 1. Boost Users
**Challenge Description:** 
Think of this as the cherry on top for our users, and an opportunity for partners to launch their project or new offerings to a wider audience through Beefy’s trusted Launchpool. This POAP would need to be a template for Beefy to create POAPs to distribute to users of the Boost feature. Content reference:
